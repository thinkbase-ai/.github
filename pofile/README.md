# ThinkBase - Safe and Trustworthy AI
Many of the world’s governments are regulating to make AI safe and trustworthy.
The problem is that the most popular techniques used, Deep Learning and Generative AI, are intrinsically unsafe and untrustworthy, as many users are discovering. Much effort is required to make them safe for some applications.

These are not the only forms of AI. There are other strong threads of research with the same pedigree that are intrinsically safe and trustworthy. 
Our product, ThinkBase, uses the best of these and has dramatically simplified the process of using them.

It depends very much on the application: Generative AI is great for creating images, writing an essay, or having a purely speculative conversation. However, such tools hallucinate – they invent things - and don’t give the same answers twice. 
For any kind of regulated process, such as finance, medicine, HR, law and science, these flaws make Generative AI very problematic, and liable to an outright ban or heavy regulation in some jurisdictions. 
ThinkBase cannot write an essay for you, but it can make decisions and predictions in a way that is completely transparent, repeatable and explainable. These properties make ThinkBase safe and trustworthy.
